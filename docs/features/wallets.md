# Wallets

Wallets give you an overview of **all your assets** (in ETH, SLP, AXS, RON and Axies) across all wallets associated with your scholarship.

Scroll down and you’ll be able to see and sort by how much each wallet contains.

**Add Wallet** by clicking the button on the right. Enter:

* Name
* Ronin address
* Label(s)

The wallet displayed at the top is your **designated treasury wallet** – this is the wallet that receives the guild share when [payments](payments.md) are processed. Set any wallet as the treasury from the action menu on the right.

Easily **search for wallets** by filtering for labels and/or entering the account name, alias, or ronin address in the search bar.
