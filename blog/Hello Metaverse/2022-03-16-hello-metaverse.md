Welcome to **Earn Management**. We are a team of web3 enthusiasts, engineers and gamers, and we build tools to empower gaming communities to **play, connect and thrive** in the metaverse.

As scholarship owners, we're all too familiar with the challenges that come with running a guild within the play-to-earn ecosystem.

We designed our tools for people like ourselves: builders and players who've stumbled upon the wild, weird, wonderful west that is blockchain-based play-to-earn gaming and discovered a goldmine of opportunity. And we'd like to share it with all of you.

Our mission is to make this vast, exciting space a better, more accessible place for everyone to navigate, whether you're here to play and connect with like-minded friends, or to grow your guild using our tools.

This journey begins with the introduction of **our first tool: [Earn Management](https://app.earnalliance.com)**.

#### Earn Management is a seamless platform of advanced automation tools we created to help you **run** and **scale** your Axie Infinity scholarship with ease.

From understanding scholar performance and automating complex payments to creating metas and distributing teams– all for **free** and **readily accessible** on a single platform– we're here for you. Check out our [roadmap](https://roadmap.earnalliance.com) to learn more about where we're heading.

We've just arrived at the new frontier. This is only the very beginning.

Welcome aboard! Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/926167446648397836/949216955708112897 'Discord') to be a part of our community. We look forward to getting to know you.
