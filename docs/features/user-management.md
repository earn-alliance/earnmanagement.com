# User Management

**There are 4 types of roles on Earn Alliance:**

1. **Owner** 

The Owner is automatically assigned to the user who started the guild account. There can only be one owner of each account and this cannot be transferred. 

2. **Admin**

Admins have the same permissions as the Owner. They can manage and access all features of the account with the exception that they cannot remove other Admins from the account. 

3. **Manager**

Managers are able to monitor and manage the performance of the scholar accounts they directly supervise, without having access to macro guild data or the ability to make changes that directly affect payments, such as manipulating the revenue share percentages or ronin addresses. 

Managers have limited permissions. They can:  
   * [Invite scholars](user-management.md#invite-users) to join Earn Management
   * Monitor scholars' performance
   * Audit scholars' accounts
   * [Flag](insights.md#flag-accounts) and add notes to accounts
   * Add, edit and remove account labels
   * Monitor their own payment breakdowns
   * Manage their own payment ronin address
   * View the guild's [Axies](axie-search.md)
   * Experiment with creating [Builds and Teams](builds-and-teams.md) templates

4. **Scholar** 

Scholars have read-only access to the [Tracker](tracker.md), [Payments](payments.md) and full access to the [Axie Search](axie-search.md). 

With an account, they can: 
   * View individual activity and performance 
   * View Historic payments and breakdowns of how they got paid
   * Manage their payment address

## Invite Users
There are 3 ways to invite users.

### Invite Scholar via Tracker

Using the [Tracker](tracker.md), you may invite a user while adding/editing an account.

When adding or editing an account, click on "scholar’s payment ronin address" _(this is the account your scholar is paid in)._

**Adjust the toggle** on the right to enter their email address instead. If they do not have an account, an invitation will be sent to their email address.

### Invite Scholar via Guild URL

Every guild account has its own unique invite URL. 

1. Go to the Settings icon _(top right_)
2. In “Manage and Invite Users,” select "Guild Settings"
3. Copy the invite URL

For security purposes, anyone signing up for or logging in to an Earn Alliance account via the invite URL will join your guild account with **scholar permissions only**. To upgrade them to admin or manager status, you can do so manually under "Manage and Invite Users."



### Invite Admin, Manager or Scholar via User Management

Earn Management has a portal for managing users.

1. Go to the Settings icon _(top right_)
2. Select “Manage and Invite Users”

Select “Invite User”

**To invite admins** to create an account via email, enter their:

* Email address
* Permission type: Admin 

**To invite managers or scholars** to create an account via email, enter their:

* Email address
* Permission type: Manager/Scholar
* Assigned scholar account (_this must be an account that’s already been added to your [Tracker](tracker.md)_)

**All invited users will be sent an invitation link** via email, and be able to sign up for an account on Earn Management.

Scholars have the option to enter their payment ronin address to sign up. Note that if their payment address is already in the system, they **will not** be able to sign up due to duplicate ronin addresses.

## Guild Settings

Under Guild Settings, you are able to 

1. Change your guild's name

![change-guild-name](06_Guild-Name.gif)

2. Invite scholars via [guild URL](user-management.md#invite-scholar-via-guild-url)

## Create New Guild 

With one login email, users can invite and accept invitations to be part of multiple guilds. In addition, they can also **create multiple new guild accounts**. 

1. To create a new guild, select "Creat New Guild" under Settings
3. Simply enter your guild's name
4. Entering the treasury ronin wallet and wallet alias is optional, but note will be mandatory to perform any payment-related actions.

### Multiple Guild Accounts 

Easily switch between guild accounts at the top left of your dashboard. If you have different roles in the guild accounts of which you are a part, those account permissions will be reflected accordingly.
