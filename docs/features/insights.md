# Insights  

The Insights feature is designed to help scholarship managers easily and efficiently monitor their scholars' and guild's performance, whether it is by:
* Auditing a scholar's performance by filtering and flagging based on SLP earned
* Getting an overview of your guild's earnings and games played across days, weeks or months
* Understanding which Axie team brings home the most earnings - no guesswork involved!  

_Note: All data in Insights starts tracking from the moment you've imported your accounts; you will not be able to immediately retrieve any data from this feature. If you're new to Earn Management, check back in 24 hours!_  

### Audit Performance

Audit Performance allows you to **quickly audit your scholars’ performance** and **immediately identify consistently high-performing, under-performing or inactive accounts**. 

You can do this using 3 filters:

1. Date range: Select the last 3, 7, 14, or 30 days 
2. Daily SLP: Select the amount/range of SLP a scholar has earned per day OR Daily Games: Select the number/range of games a scholar has played per day
3. Number of Days: Select the  # of days the scholar has earned the selected range of SLP / played the selected range of games

The accounts that meet the selected criteria will appear below. For each account, you'll be able to see: 

* The # of days it logged x amount or range of daily SLP or daily games
* Today's Games Played
* Week's Games Played
* Today’s SLP 
* Week SLP: Total SLP this week 
* MMR/Rank
* Lifetime value

#### Inactive Accounts 

The best use case of this feature is **screening for accounts that have not been active**. 

For example: You'd like to vet for inactive accounts that have logged 0 SLP for 3 days within the last 3 days.

1. Select “Last 3 Days” for time frame 
2. On the “Daily SLP” slider, drag it to 0 
3. On the “# Days” slider, drag it to 3 days

You will see below that in this scholarship, 98 accounts have registered 0 SLP every day for the last 3 days.

#### Flag Accounts

After generating a list of accounts you're interested in, you are able to flag all accounts at once by clicking Select All and Bulk Flag Accounts. 

![BulkFlag](09_BulkFlag.gif)

Or flag accounts individually using the action menu on the right.  

![BulkFlag_AddFlag](09_BulkFlag_AddFlag.gif)

Each time you flag an account, you have the option of adding a note. Expand each account to view its note log.

In the action menu, you can also clear all the flags associated with an account. This is especially helpful if a new scholar has started playing on that account and a reset is needed.

Note that accounts can have a maximum of 3 flags. Any attempt to add any additional flags will result in an error message.

Beyond the day-to-day account tracking, the Insights feature gives you a high-level, big-picture view of which - and the number of - accounts that are performing in a specific catergory, and allows you to organize your monitoring process in a systematic way.  

### Guild Performance 

In addition to tracking how individual scholars' performance, you can also get an **overview of your guild's health** in Guild Performance. 

Switch between Month, Week and Day views to view:
* Scholars' highest, lowest and average rank
* Average SLP earned 
* Win rate
* Average MMR  
* Total games played 
* Total Earnings

### Axie Teams

In the Axie Teams tab, you'll be able to see your guild's **Axie teams ranked from highest-performing to lowest-performing**, according to SLP earned. Expand each row to quickly see which of your accounts are using these teams, and what order they have their Axies in.
