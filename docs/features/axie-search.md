# Axies 

Our Axie dashboard gives you **a master overview of the Axies you own** across _all_ your tracked ronin wallets. Though you can also see any individual accounts' Axies from the [Tracker](tracker.md).

This is helpful because:

* While there are many available tools that show you every Axie’s gene composition, you can **quickly search for Axies by stats, parts or genes**, instead of clicking to view the Axies one by one or using excel sheets to organize.
* This is your **key to breeding**. If you know your metas and know exactly what Axies you need to breed, you can filter for a very specific group of high-quality Axies that match your meta.

For example, we are looking to breed Axies with:

* Breed count: 0
* R1 and R2 parts: Ronin, Imp, Nutcracker

The filter immediately gives us a masterview of all of our Axies that fit the bill, so to speak.

Using our advanced search, **filter your Axies** by:

1. Class
    * Aquatic
    * Beast
    * Bird
    * Bug
    * Dawn
    * Dusk
    * Mech
    * Plant
    * Reptile

2. Lifestage

3. Breed count

Adjust the toggle on both ends to select any range between 0 – 7 breed counts.

4. Parts

In the search field, enter the part you wish to search for. To select, click the desired part that appears in the column.

* To filter for dominant genes, leave R1 and R2 checkboxes blank.
* To filter for R1 _or_ R2 genes, select the respective checkboxes under each part.
* Selecting both R1 _and_ R2 genes for each part will filter for Axies with both R1 and R2 genes.
* To select multiple parts, enter in the search field and click into the part. Select as many parts as you’d like.

_Note: every search of multiple parts is a function of “and,” not “or.” For example, if you’re searching for two parts (i.e. Ronin and Imp), the Axies that appear share both Ronin and Imp parts._

5. Stats

Adjust the toggle on both ends to select any range for Health, Speed, Skill and Morale.

After filtering your Axies, you’ll be able to see them by selecting the **gallery or list view**.

Select “Clear All” on the left to **reset your search**.

### Filter Axies by Account(s) and Label(s)

To view Axies from specific account(s) or label(s) only, use the filters on the top to select individual or multiple accounts and labels.

### Send Axies 

To **transfer Axies to scholar accounts directly from your Axies dashboard**, make sure you've installed the latest version of [Wallet Commander](wallet-commander.md). 

If you've installed the Wallet Commander for the first time, open up the Wallet Commander and enter the transfer command by copying it directly from the Axie page.

![03_Axies_Connect-Wallet-Commander](03_Axies_Connect-Wallet-Commander.mp4)


To start an Axie transfer, **click on the little blue arrow at the top right of the Axie card**. Search for / select the account you're wanting to send the Axie to in the dropdown. 

![03_Axies_send-axie](03_Axies_send-axie.mp4)

If you don't have a specific target wallet in mind, use the quick filters to curate wallets with 0 Axies in them, and/or wallets that are not assigned to scholars.

If all goes to plan, a success message will appear at the top right. And that's Axie sending, done and done!
